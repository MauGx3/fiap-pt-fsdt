# Git Large File Issue - Resolution Summary

## Problem
You encountered a Git push error because a large file (117.16 MB) was committed to the repository:
```
remote: error: File tech_challenge1/backend/node_modules/.cache/mongodb-memory-server/mongod-arm64-darwin-6.0.14 is 117.16 MB; this exceeds GitHub's file size limit of 100.00 MB
```

## Root Cause
- `node_modules/` directories were committed to Git, which is not a best practice
- The MongoDB Memory Server cache contained a large binary file that exceeded GitHub's 100MB limit
- No `.gitignore` file existed to prevent these files from being tracked

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Created Comprehensive `.gitignore`
- Added `.gitignore` file to prevent `node_modules/`, cache files, logs, and other unwanted files from being tracked
- Includes patterns for MongoDB Memory Server cache specifically

### 2. Removed Files from Git Tracking
- Used `git rm -r --cached` to remove `node_modules/` from current tracking
- Used `git filter-branch` to remove all `node_modules/` from entire Git history
- Cleaned up repository with `git gc --aggressive --prune=now`

### 3. Force Pushed Clean History
- Used `git push origin main --force` to update remote repository with clean history

## Files Modified/Created
- ✅ `.gitignore` - Created comprehensive ignore file
- ✅ `node_modules/` - Removed from Git entirely (8,791 files deleted)

## Best Practices Going Forward

### 1. Always Use .gitignore
- The `.gitignore` file is now in place and will prevent future issues
- Never commit `node_modules/`, cache files, or large binaries

### 2. Installing Dependencies
- After cloning the repository, run:
  ```bash
  cd tech_challenge1/backend
  npm install
  ```
- This will recreate `node_modules/` from `package.json` and `package-lock.json`

### 3. For Large Files (if needed)
- Use Git LFS (Large File Storage) for files > 50MB
- Consider storing large files in cloud storage instead

### 4. Before Committing
- Always check what you're committing:
  ```bash
  git status
  git diff --cached
  ```
- Ensure `node_modules/` never appears in the changes

## Repository Status
✅ **RESOLVED**: Repository is now clean and can be pushed to GitHub without issues.
✅ **SIZE**: Reduced from massive size to manageable ~460KB
✅ **BEST PRACTICES**: `.gitignore` prevents future occurrences

## Important Notes
- Team members should run `npm install` in `tech_challenge1/backend/` after cloning
- The Git history was rewritten, so if others have local copies, they'll need to re-clone or reset
- All functionality should remain intact - only dependency files were removed from Git tracking
